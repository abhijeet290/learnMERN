// 1. Basic Usage of reduce
// Find the sum of all elements in an array using reduce().
// Find the product of all elements in an array using reduce().
// Use reduce() to find the maximum number in an array.
// Use reduce() to find the minimum number in an array.
// 2. Using reduce() with Objects and Arrays
// Convert an array of numbers into an object where keys are numbers and values are their squares.
// Given an array of strings, count the occurrences of each word using reduce().
// Given an array of student objects, use reduce() to find the total marks of all students.
// 3. reduce() with Initialization Values
// Use reduce() with an initial value to calculate the sum of an array, starting from 10.
// Find the longest string in an array using reduce().
// Flatten a nested array using reduce().
// 4. Chaining reduce() with Other Methods
// Use map() and reduce() to find the sum of squares of an array.
// Use filter() and reduce() to find the sum of only even numbers in an array.
// Use reduce() to merge multiple arrays into a single array.
// 5. Advanced reduce() Operations
// Create an array of transactions and use reduce() to find the total balance.
// Given an array of words, use reduce() to find the longest word.
// Implement reduce() to simulate the functionality of map() (transform each element).
// Implement reduce() to simulate the functionality of filter() (remove elements based on a condition).
// Given an array of objects representing books (title, author, price), use reduce() to calculate the total price of all books.
