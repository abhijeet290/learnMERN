// 1. Basics of Sets
// Create a Set from an array and print all its elements.
// Check the size of a Set after adding different elements.
// Add multiple values (including duplicate ones) to a Set and verify if it stores only unique values.
// Remove an element from a Set and check if it exists.
// Try to add null and undefined to a Set and see what happens.
// 2. Set Operations
// Convert a Set into an array.
// Given an array with duplicate elements, remove duplicates using a Set.
// Find the union of two sets.
// Find the intersection of two sets.
// Find the difference between two sets (elements in Set A but not in Set B).
// 3. Iterating Over Sets
// Iterate through a Set using a for-of loop.
// Iterate through a Set using the .forEach() method.
// Convert a Set to an array and use .map() to transform its values.
// Convert a Set into an object where keys are the set elements and values are their indices.
// 4. Real-World Applications
// Implement a function that checks if a sentence has all unique characters using a Set.
// Given an array of names, count how many unique names exist using a Set.
// Implement a username validation system where duplicate usernames are not allowed (using a Set).
// Implement a voting system where each person can vote only once (using a Set).
// Write a function that checks if two arrays have any common elements using a Set.
// Create a cache system using a Set where only the last 5 accessed elements are stored.
